Question
    do we have one implementation of cache or several?
    - difference either in
	 memory allocation
	    fixed sized
	    slab - reset and free does not reset and free of the whole allocator
		   instead only one size class is reset.
	 caching strategy
	 bounded cache



    - do we handle element lifetime? maximum bound on lifetime?

    - least frequently used - 
	- add this as extraction callback (like we did with hash table?)
	- add least recently used timestamp as API for release function?
	Nonstarters:
	- based on the time when the object was returned by cache? no way! 
	- no way to add least recently timestamp to cached object as data.
	
    - least recently used:
	implement as a heap sorted by least recently used?
	    heap is tree structure or array?

    - what is the timestamp?
	second, miliseconds, microseconds? simple opaque 64 bit int?
    	    - opaque typedef that can be any of this + structre (as long as functions for manipulation are there)
	    
	

Interface
    Called by user
	- alloc object 
        - free object to cache  
    Called by cache	
	- destroy object and free to cache.
- this is an interface that is different from normal memory allocator.


Two kinds of caches: 
    - fixed size object cache
    - slab cache.


Implementation: fixed size allocator is similar to pool of objects?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

that is fixed size allocator can have a mode to work as a pool; all we
need is a pooled object constructor and destructor callback.

Now when a fixed size element is first allocated (for first time) we run
the object constructor;

when we delete the whole pool (or reuse it) destructor in invoked on every 
initialized element.

? do we have a function to limit the number of pooled objects that reside
  in the free list ?

------------------

fixed allocator initialisation: the size of each element has to be increased
by sizeof(void *) bytes: when the element enters the free list we have to
put in on the list, so first void * bytes get overwritten:

Two approaches:
    - put the pointer past end of the object so that we won't conflict with custom user supplied alignment (allocate element size + sizeof(pointer))
    - separate list (unrolled) for cached objects.
    - freelist for destroyed objects.

if we wan't ability to limit the number of *created* objects on stack (i.e. on
freelist there can be either created or uninitialized object) then we
have to add some bit indicating that object is either in created or free
state (maybe since pointer is aligned to some bytes at least (???) then we can
steal a bit from the pointer ?)

- better solution: keep two freelists - one for free and initialized objects, the other for free and unitialized objects. 

Implementation
--------------
do we add pooling as a derived class of the fixed memory allocator, or do
we munch it in as a separate mode?

PRO:
 reuse: ?? also need pooling with slab allocator ?? 
 maintainability? separation of concerns?

CONS:
