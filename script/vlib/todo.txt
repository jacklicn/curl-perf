Question:
    VCONTEXT - include reset allocator in vtable interface?

====================================================================
Documentation:
--------------

IN means the parameter is only read and left untouched

OUT means that the parameter will be written to, *but its original contents will be ignored*, 

IN OUT means that the parameter will be read from *and* written to. Try to express that with "const". 

OPTIONAL means that a zero can be passed for that parameter, and it won't affect the function.

TODO

  general io gadget (???) (BIO - VIO)
    [parsing framework ??? ]
       configuration file
	  logging/tracing (KuKu)


- all data structures (most) - merge two objects
	- relevant for: lists, dynamic arrays, hash tables, heaps? 

- sorting
    (what kind of sorting - stable/unstable?)
	- interesting: glibc does mergesort for smaller arrays and quicksort for large arrays. 


- unrolled list - functional interface
  General: functional/MACRO interface for iteration over range
  Delete function: (like unrolled list/heaps).
  compact function (if number of elements falls below half used, try to push elements to adjacent lists.
 

- object serialisation .... whats the best way ?
			

TEST TES TESTS
  test - have to test reverse list, nth element access.  
  test - more test for string.
  ring buffer - test compaction, bulk add.

  - test coverage? on gcc only!
  - valgrind run on gcc!
TOADD:
 
  
  Search trees - radix trees in particular.  
  splay trees, red black trees?; avl trees?
  Property lists: PLISTS - configuration interface.

	
  Coalesced hashing is cool - add it.
  
  memory allocator - read stuff
   - learn from heaplayers. do somehting similar.
 
  IO buffer - what is missing from BIO?
    - what are the requirements for BIO?



BIG TOYS

  parsing framework?
  protocol generation?
   

ADD 

  unit test with performence in mind (measures execution time of tests + repeat test).
    
  make friends with doxygen

  VCONTEXT - add some dynamic array as member (per context memory (like portable tls)).

  What about locking????
    decide what to do.

INVESTIGATE
  lockless data structures

CHANGE  
  common error codes instead of -1 (ERRNO numbers can be used ???)


=========================
- consistant naming of structure members (make up a dictionary).
  Common naming schema for member vars.
	elmsize - size of one element.
	elmcount - current number of elements.
	elmmaxcount  - space allocated for a maximum number of elements.
	    buffer	     - data area.
